--------------------------------
Panther is a free and open source program that you can use to 
encode your media files from one format to the other. It has 
a simple user interface and should be very easy to get started 
with. It can even reduce the size of music files.

Please let me know if you have any feedback, suggestions or bug 
reports for the program. I will be glad to look into them.
